## Abstract
A cryptographic system transmits a computationally secure cryptogram over an insecure communication channel without prearrangement of a cipher key. A secure cipher key is generated by the conversers from transformations of exchanged transformed signals. The conversers each possess a secret signal and exchange an initial transformation of the secret signal with the other converser. The received transformation of the other converser's secret signal is again transformed with the receiving converser's secret signal to generate a secure cipher key. The transformations use non-secret operations that are easily performed but extremely difficult to invert. It is infeasible for an eavesdropper to invert the initial transformation to obtain either conversers' secret signal, or duplicate the latter transformation to obtain the secure cipher key.

## Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange Algorithm  

1. **Transformation and Exchange Process:**
    - Each participant (converser) begins with a secret signal.
    - They transform their secret signal using public parameters and exchange the transformed signal with the other participant.
    - The transformation involves raising a base number to the power of their secret signal, modulo a large prime number.
    - The received transformed signal from the other participant is then re-transformed with the participant's own secret signal to generate a secure cipher key.

2. **Equations Involved:**
    - **Initial Transformation:** $Y_i = a^{X_i} \mod q$
      - Where $Y_i$ is the transformed signal, $a$ is the base number, $X_i$ is the secret signal, and $q$ is the large prime number.
    - **Secure Cipher Key Generation:** $K = (Y_j)^{X_i} \mod q = a^{X_i X_j} \mod q$
      - $K$ is the secure cipher key generated by both participants using the other's transformed signal $Y_j$ and their own secret signal $X_i$.

3. **Implementation Details:**
    - The transformation functions use non-secret operations that are easy to perform but difficult to invert, making it infeasible for an eavesdropper to obtain the secret signals or the secure cipher key.
    - The secure key generation method described allows communication over an insecure channel without prior exchange of a cipher key, enhancing security and privacy.
