# Fundamental-Cryptography

# Primitive functions for Cryptographic systems

The cryptographic algorithms AES-Rijndael, RSA, and Diffie-Hellman, while distinct in application and design, share common mathematical underpinnings that facilitate secure communication. Each of these systems begins with the reception of input values or keys, denoted as $\alpha$ and $\beta$. These initial values are crucial as they seed the subsequent transformations and encryptions. In particular, these inputs are subjected to an initial transformation $\Phi$, which may involve key expansion in AES, the generation of public keys in Diffie-Hellman, or modular arithmetic in RSA.

Key generation is central to each of these algorithms and is represented by the function $\Lambda$. This function takes the initial inputs and possibly large prime or composite numbers, denoted as $\eta$ or $\xi$, to produce encryption and decryption keys. The RSA algorithm utilizes these prime numbers to establish a robust framework for secure key exchange, while Diffie-Hellman leverages them for creating a shared secret over an insecure channel. AES uses a similar process for generating a series of round keys for its block cipher operation. 

The heart of these cryptographic systems is the encryption and decryption process, signified by the functions $\Omega$ and $\Theta$. Encryption transforms plaintext into unreadable ciphertext using generated keys, while decryption inverts this process, returning the ciphertext to its original plaintext form. These operations rely on complex mathematical computations like modular exponentiation, ensuring that without the correct keys, deciphering the encrypted information is computationally infeasible.

Finally, an additional layer of security in cryptographic systems is introduced through pseudo-random operations, represented by the function $\Gamma$. These operations add complexity and unpredictability to the cryptographic process, thwarting attempts at pattern recognition, such as those used in differential power analysis. By incorporating pseudo-random values into the encryption process or using them in the generation of cryptographic keys, these algorithms enhance their resilience against various forms of cryptographic attacks.

In summary, although AES-Rijndael, RSA, and Diffie-Hellman differ in their specific mechanisms and use cases, they share a reliance on initial value processing, complex transformations for key generation, and the fundamental principles of encryption and decryption. Each system utilizes mathematical rigor and computational complexity to achieve its security goals, with prime number theory and modular arithmetic forming the backbone of these cryptographic giants.


In cryptographic systems like AES-Rijndael, RSA, and Diffie-Hellman, secure communication is enabled through a series of mathematical transformations. The initial stage in these algorithms involves the acceptance of input values or keys, denoted by $\alpha$ and $\beta$. These inputs are essential, as they set the stage for the key generation and encryption processes that follow. They are subjected to an initial transformation function, $\Phi$, which can take different forms depending on the algorithm:

- For AES-Rijndael, $\Phi$ might represent key expansion.
- In Diffie-Hellman, $\Phi$ typically involves generating public keys.
- For RSA, $\Phi$ could represent the modular arithmetic used in generating public and private keys.

This can be represented mathematically as:
$$\Phi(\alpha, \beta) \rightarrow \text{Intermediate values for further processing}$$

Key generation, represented by the function $\Lambda$, is the next critical step. It leverages the initial inputs and may incorporate large prime or composite numbers, symbolized by $\eta$ or $\xi$, to produce keys essential for the encryption and decryption processes. This step is described by the equation:
$$\Lambda(\alpha, \beta, \eta \text{ or } \xi) \rightarrow \text{Keys for encryption and decryption}$$

For encryption and decryption, the algorithms use two functions, $\Omega$ for encryption and $\Theta$ for decryption, which utilize the keys generated by $\Lambda$ to transform plaintext to ciphertext and vice versa:
$$\Omega(\text{Plaintext}, \text{Key}) \rightarrow \text{Ciphertext}$$
$$\Theta(\text{Ciphertext}, \text{Key}) \rightarrow \text{Plaintext}$$

These functions perform complex mathematical operations like modular exponentiation, ensuring that without the correct keys, deciphering the encrypted data remains a challenging task.

An additional security layer is introduced by the function $\Gamma$, which handles pseudo-random operations to add complexity and unpredictability, effectively enhancing the security of cryptographic processes. This could involve generating pseudo-random values for use in the encryption process or the generation of cryptographic keys:
$$\Gamma(\text{Input parameters}) \rightarrow \text{Pseudo-random values or sequences}$$

While AES-Rijndael, RSA, and Diffie-Hellman have unique mechanisms and applications, they share fundamental principles like the processing of initial values, complex transformations for key generation, and encryption/decryption methods. All three algorithms employ mathematical rigor and computational complexity, relying on the security provided by prime number theory and modular arithmetic to protect data.
