## Algorithmic Sequence in Table Format

| Step | Process | Mathematical Representation |
|------|---------|-----------------------------|
| 1    | Key Storage | Store final set of $N_k$ round-key words. |
| 2    | Key Expansion | Perform $\Lambda$ in a forward direction to obtain $w[i]$ for $i = 0$ to $N_b(N_r + 1) - 1$. |
| 3    | On-the-fly Key Generation for Decryption | For $i \geq N_k$, generate $w[i - N_k]$ using $\Psi(w[i], w[i - 1], \Theta)$ as needed. |
| 4    | S-box Substitution | Apply $S$ for byte substitution in $\Theta$ based on conditions (e.g., $i \mod N_k = 0$). |
| 5    | Pseudo-random Pathway Selection | Use $R$ to select pathways to S-boxes for byte substitution in $\Theta$. |
| 6    | Differential Power Analysis Countermeasure | Implement $\Sigma$ using a dummy circuit with pseudo-random noise for the initial $P$ operation. |
| 7    | Pre-mix and Encryption Round Combination | Combine $P$ with the first $E$ round, applying pre-processed cipher key and pre-mixed plaintext. |
